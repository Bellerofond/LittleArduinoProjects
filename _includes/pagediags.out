It is not particularly noticable in my pictures,\nbut IRL the result seemed a bit better:\n\n![build_01_led_resistor_selection](./assets/build_01_led_resistor_selection.jpg?raw=true)\n\n## Circuit Design\n\nHere's the schematic from Boldport:\n\n![Schematic](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/539604e8e4b0d1f9ffe9ff0b/t/5b8e55478a922d7beeb03d32/1536054615456/infographic.jpg?format=2500w)\n\nAnd here's a quick redraw, focusing just on a single segment control across 3 digits. The key things to note:\n\n* segment and digit selection inputs are active high logic (common cathode)\n* an example of traditional grid multiplexing: enable to segment, and enable the digit to light\n* yellow LEDs have lower resistor value to ensure red and yellow LEDs run at roughly the same perceived brightness\n\nThe schematic fragment shows a single segment control across 3 digits.\nNote: Ra1, Ra2 are 1kΩ in original kit, but swapped for 680Ω to equalise apparent brightness of red and yellow LEDs.\n\n![Breadboard](./assets/3x7_bb.jpg?raw=true)\n\n![Schematic](./assets/3x7_schematic.jpg?raw=true)\n\n\n## Construction\n\nI actually super-glued the LEDs to the face plate in preparation for assembly.\nIt seemd the best way to ensure alignment, and also provide maximal illumination for each segment.\n\n![build_03_boards_ready](./assets/build_03_boards_ready.jpg?raw=true)\n\nTest, test and test again during construction! Once assembeld, I knew that any issues would be\na major exercise to rectify. And since the kit is already sold out on Boldport - no chance to\njust buy a replacement!\n\n![build_02_led_test](./assets/build_02_led_test.jpg?raw=true)\n\nFully assembled, with \"333\" powered directly from a 5V source:\n\n![build_04_test_top_side](./assets/build_04_test_top_side.jpg?raw=true)\n\n![build_04_test_rear](./assets/build_04_test_rear.jpg?raw=true)\n\n![build_04_test_rear_side](./assets/build_04_test_rear_side.jpg?raw=true)\n\n![build_04_test_right_side](./assets/build_04_test_right_side.jpg?raw=true)\n\n## Next...\n\nSo far so good! I have a few projects in mind to follow.\n\nThe LED segments illuminate very nicely. I think super-gluing the LEDs to the face plate was a good decision.\nBut I also notice quite a bit of bleed from a lit segment to unlit segments.\nIn retrospect, I think it would have been a good idea to put baffles between the LEDs\nor paint their sides with an opaque coating to ensure all illumination only radiates via the face plate.\n\n\n![Build](./assets/3x7_build.jpg?raw=true)\n\n## Credits and References\n* [Boldport Club 3x7](https://www.boldport.com/products/3x7) - product page\n* [..as mentioned on my blog](https://blog.tardate.com/2018/10/leap425-look-inside-a-7-segment-with-the-boldport-3x7.html)\n", "dir"=>"/BoldportClub/3x7/", "name"=>"README.md", "path"=>"BoldportClub/3x7/README.md", "url"=>"/BoldportClub/3x7/"}
