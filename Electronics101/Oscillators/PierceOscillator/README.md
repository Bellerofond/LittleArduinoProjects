## Notes

The Pierce oscillator is named for its inventor, George W. Pierce (1872-1956). It is a derivative of the Colpitts oscillator,
and can be implemented using a minimum of components. Typically: a digital inverter, one resistor, two capacitors, and a quartz crystal.

The circuit I'm testing here is from [KF5OBS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OsvXQe_l2E). It features:
* BJT in place of the digital inverter
* takes advantage of the base-emitter capacitance to eliminate one capacitor


### Power Consumption

| Supply | Current |
|--------|---------|
| 5V     | 2.6mA   |
| 9V     | 4.4mA   |


### Sample Traces

I've tested with a range of crystals from 1Mhz to 16MHz, all oscillate satisfatorily.

Here's a trace with 7MHz crystal, 9V supply:

And 16MHz crystal, 9V supply:
