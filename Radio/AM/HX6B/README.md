## Notes

Just my notes on a build of [a HX-6B kit from a seller on aliexpress](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/DIY-Kits-Superheterodyne-Radio-Receiver-6-Transistor-sch-case-w-Speaker/32367150788.html).

A superheterodyne receiver (often shortened to superhet) uses frequency mixing to convert a received signal
(at a variable frequency)
to a fixed intermediate frequency (IF) which can be more conveniently processed with known gain and selectivity.
