## Notes

It's common to find the 28BYJ-48 stepper motor and a X113647 Stepper Motor Driver Board in Arduino starter kits.

However documentation is scant and the board is not exactly compatible with the standard Stepper library.

See the [X113647Stepper github page](https://github.com/tardate/X113647Stepper) for details of the library, example programs, and custom Fritzing parts for the components.
